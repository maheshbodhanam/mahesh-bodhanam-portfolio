## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Approach

This project follows a component-based architecture using React for fast builds and development. Here's a high-level structure:

```
src/
├── assets/          # Images, icons
├── components/      # Reusable UI components (Navbar, Skills, etc.)
├── pages/           # Route-based components (Home, Projects, Contact)
├── constants/       # Static data like skills and project info
├── App.jsx          # Main component with routing
└── main.jsx         # Entry point

```
## Design Approach

Tailwind CSS was used for utility-first styling, ensuring responsiveness and clean layout.

**Reusable Components:** All sections like ProjectCard and SkillBadge are modular and scalable.

**Minimal Dependencies:** Lightweight, no external UI library dependencies.

**Performance Focused:** Optimized images and lazy loading where applicable.
